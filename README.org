* J & APL study
Various helps for learning the J and APL programming languages.

- =j-flashcards.org= contains =org-drill= cards, one for each part of speech in J.
- =apl-flashcards.org= contains =org-drill= cards, one for each primitive in APL.
** TODO
Please fork the repo and add another child node in each =org-drill= card to
provide an monadic and dyadic example of use.
