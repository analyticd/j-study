* J & APL study
Various helps for learning the =J= and =APL= programming languages.

- =j-flashcards.org= contains =org-drill= cards, one for each part of speech in =J=.
- =apl-flashcards.org= contains =org-drill= cards, one for each primitive in =APL=.
** TODO
Please fork the repo and add another child node in each =org-drill= card to
provide an monadic and dyadic example of use.
** Note
The =org-drill= cards are generated from the =org= tables using the =org-drill-table= package.
